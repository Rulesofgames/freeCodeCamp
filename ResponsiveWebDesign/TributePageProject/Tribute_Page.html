		    <h2 class="h2_css">Introduction</h2>
		    	<p>Pichai Sundararajan (born June 10, 1972), better known as Sundar Pichai is an Indian-American business executive. He is the chief executive officer (CEO) of Alphabet Inc. and its subsidiary Google. Pichai was included in Time's annual list of the 100 most influential people in 2016 and 2020.</p>
		        <p>Under Pichai's leadership, Google invested in new opportunities such as Google Cloud and YouTube and continues to research advanced technologies, including machine learning and quantum computing.</p>
		        <p>In 2021, Sundar Pichai stated that artificial intelligence, when machines are programmed to simulate the human mind and solve problems and mimic human activity, "will have a bigger impact than most of the breakthroughs in recent history" and "can make humans more productive than we ever imagined." Pichai expects AI to play a foundational role in every aspect of our lives, by mimicking human tasks, from healthcare and education to how we manufacture things and consume information.</p>
		        
		        <p>In 2021, Alphabet crossed $2 trillion in market value due to sales and profit growth during the COVID-19 pandemic. While many other technology giants embrace the metaverse as the next frontier of growth, Sundar Pichai sees Google's future in its oldest offering, the Internet search, with consumers asking computers more questions with voice and multimodal experiences.</p>
		        <p>To Pichai's point, environmental concerns can impact where young employees want to work. Hence,Sundar Pichai has committed to running Google data centers and campuses on 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030.That's why Google want to run our data centers on carbon-free energy, 24/7. So, in the future, every search you do, every YouTube video you watch, every Gmail you send will be powered by clean energy sources like wind, solar, and geothermal. And our goal is to do all this by 2030.</p>

			    	<p>
			    	  He was born to a middle class family in Madurai, Tamil Nadu and brought up in Ashok Nagar, Chennai. His mother, Lakshmi Pichai was a Stenographer and father Ragunatha Pichai was an Electrical engineer at General Electric Company, the Conglomerate. His father had a manufacturing plant that produced electrical components and that's where Sundar Pichai got his interest in technology. His father introduced him to technology by sharing stories and challenges that he faced during his work day. His first encounter with technology and the first time Pichai was introduced to the technology was when he was 12 and his family bought their first telephone. He discovered how effortlessly he recalls the digits and he would remember every number he dialed. He did not know, of course, how useful this skill would be in the future.
